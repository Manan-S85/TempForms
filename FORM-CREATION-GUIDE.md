## 🎉 Form Creation Success!

When you create a form using the TempForms API, here's exactly what you get back:

### ✅ Your Form Was Created Successfully!

**📋 Form Details:**
- **Title:** My Test Form  
- **Description:** Testing form creation
- **Fields:** 2 fields (Name and Email)
- **Expires:** In 1 hour (default)

### 🔗 Your Important Links:

#### 🌐 **PUBLIC LINK** (Share this with people to fill your form):
```
https://stealth-forms.vercel.app/form/[unique-code]
```

#### 🔒 **PRIVATE LINK** (View responses - keep this secret):
```
https://stealth-forms.vercel.app/responses/[unique-code]
```

### 📱 How to Use:

1. **Share the PUBLIC link** with anyone you want to fill your form
2. **Keep the PRIVATE link** safe - this is how you view all responses
3. **Form expires automatically** after the time you set (default: 1 hour)

### 🚀 Next Steps:

- Copy your PUBLIC link and share it with people
- Bookmark your PRIVATE link to check responses later
- The form is live and ready to receive responses!
